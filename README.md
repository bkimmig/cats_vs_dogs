# Cats Vs. Dogs (and TensorFlow!)

This is a project to classify cats and dogs in images. The data was taken from a <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/'> Kaggle </a> data set with images of <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats'> cats and dogs </a>. 

Can make new submissions <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition'> here </a>

## Motivation

This is primarily a project to get familiar with <a href='https://www.tensorflow.org/'> TesorFlow </a>. I have used in in the past for classifying the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database'> MNIST </a> dataset, but wanted to get more experience than following a tutorial.

## Method

Mentioned above, I will be using <a href='https://www.tensorflow.org/'> TesorFlow </a> to classify images of cats and dogs. I will be using a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network'> Convolutional Neural Network </a> (CNN) to classify the images.
